# Getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-assignment

This code was written as part of the getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-assignment. The requirements were as follows:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 different subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed.

The code combines the training dataset and the test dataset, and as part of the assignment requirements extracted partial variables for another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

The new tidy data set contains variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.
